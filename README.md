I have correctly implemented the index, resume and bio .html and .css files,
along with a contact .html and .css file.
The index file has links to my 3 other files, along with my name and a 
photo of myself. 
They pass the w3 tests with no errors.
However, they are not fully adaptable to small window sizes 
(i.e. mobile devices).

I discussed this assignment with Andrew Cavallaro.

I took anywhere from 5-12 hours to complete this assignment. I would say 
about 5 hours were spent specifically working on this assignment, but 
I also spent a lot of time messing around with html and css to find out more about them
while working.
